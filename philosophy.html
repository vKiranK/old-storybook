	<h1>Philosophy</h1>
	<p>
	The goal of the project is, as stated before, to each the Telugu South Indian language through a direct-method reader approach WITHOUT grammar worksheets and boring drills. No translation exercises. No grammar worksheets. No contrived sentences.
	<br><br>
		The project is and will always be 100% FREE -- no subscriptions, no 100mb of junk tracker spyware, no sign-ins, no annoying ads. Just 100% high-quality Telugu content.
	<br><br>
	Furthermore, the project is open-source; all code, images, audio clips, and other files used to create the website can be found on our Github. Link is <a href="https://github.com/vKiranK/storybook">here</a>. 
	<br><br>
	The site is made with html/css/javascript; there is very little javascript, only the bare minimum necessary to make the site function. All of the files on the site, from images to audio files, are designed to be relatively small, so the site should load quickly, even on slow rural connections.
