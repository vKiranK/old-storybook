	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	This is a website intended to teach the Telugu South Indian language through a direct-method reader approach. The goal is to provide a free, online resource for learning the language WITHOUT grammar worksheets and boring drills.
	<br><br>
	The project is also hosted on Github. Link is <a href="https://github.com/vKiranK/storybook">here</a>. If you want to contribute to the project, you can do so easily on the Github page (submitting a pull request is easy -- it only takes a few minutes!); you do not have to email me or contact me in any way.
