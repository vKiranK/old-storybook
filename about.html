	<p>
	This is a website intended to teach the Telugu South Indian language through a direct-method reader approach. The goal is to provide a free, online resource without any rote learning (drills, worksheets, etc). The thinking behind the resource creation is inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUc_W3xE1w">Comprehensible Input Theory</a>.
	<br><br>
	The project is also hosted on <a href="https://github.com/vKiranK/storybook">Github</a>. If you want to contribute to the project, submit a pull request.
