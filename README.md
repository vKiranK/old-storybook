# storybook
###  Warning: This repository will soon be deprecated as the project will be transitioning to a react.js application under a new github repo.

Online interactive storybook written in the Telugu language -- a **direct-method approach** to learning the language. The goal is to provide a free, online resource for learning the language WITHOUT grammar worksheets and boring drills.    
Try it out for yourself at https://vkirank.com/storybook/home.html.  
Created with html/css as well as some simple Javascript with jQuery. If you want to improve the website or add your own storybook chapter, you can submit a pull request. Please make sure the files you submit are stylistically and structurally similar to the rest of the site.  
## Inspirations/Credits
My goal with this project is to make a resource similar to [Amarahasa](https://en.amarahasa.com) or *Lingua Latina per se illustrata*. Although resources like this exist, nobody has bothered to make one for Telugu specifically.
